This was the final project of IOT course which involves the development of an IoT system controlled via a web server hosted on an ESP32 microcontroller. The system interacts with an SRF04 ultrasonic distance sensor, LEDs, and a Servo motor. 
A mobile phone acts as the client, connecting to the system through a local Wi-Fi network. The project showcases real-time sensor data monitoring and actuator control via a web interface.
There is also a report availabe in Persian language.
